# Hilla React todo app

This is a demo app showing how to build a Todo app using:

- [Hilla + React](https://hilla.dev)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

NOTE: The use of MongoDB and React Query is optional, they are not required by Hilla. 
Hilla supports any database that works with Spring Boot. 
You can connect to the backend using the generated TS methods without React Query. 


## Requirements

- Java 11 +
- MongoDB

## Running the app development server

1. Ensure you have `mongod` running.
2. Start the Hilla development server using the included Maven wrapper `./mvnw`
